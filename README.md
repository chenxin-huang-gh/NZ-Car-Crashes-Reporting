# NZ-Car-Crashes-Reporting(Ongoing)
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing New Zealand road crashes (2000–2025). Features KPI cards, trend analysis, severity distribution, speed limit comparisons, and fatality rate insights using CAS open data.

# Key Findings

Overall Trends: From 2000 to 2025, the total number of reported crashes in New Zealand showed fluctuations, with a general downward trend in recent years.

Severity Distribution: The majority of crashes were non-injury crashes (≈70%), while fatal crashes accounted for only around 1% but remain a critical focus for safety policy.

Speed Limit Impact: Fatal crashes were most frequent in areas with a 100 km/h speed limit, reflecting higher risks on highways.

Fatality Rate Anomaly: Despite low absolute crash counts, roads with a 10 km/h speed limit had a disproportionately high fatality rate, suggesting possible under-reporting of non-fatal incidents or unique risk factors (e.g., shared spaces, pedestrian-heavy zones).

# Recommendations / Next Steps

Policy Focus: Investigate the anomaly at 10 km/h zones to assess whether traffic calming measures or improved road design are needed.

Targeted Interventions: Strengthen safety measures for high-speed roads (≥100 km/h) where most fatal crashes occur.

Data Enhancement: Combine CAS data with weather, vehicle type, or driver demographics to build richer predictive models.

Future Dashboard Iteration: Add interactive regional breakdown maps and time-of-day analysis to support more granular decision-making.
